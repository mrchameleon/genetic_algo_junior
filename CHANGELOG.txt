improvements made:


1. Centralized Ranges

All numeric ranges are now in DNA.RANGES static object
Easy to modify ranges in one place
Mutation amounts are also centralized
Cleaner code with const r = DNA.RANGES shorthand

2. New Draw Order

Arms and legs draw first (behind body)
Hands and feet next
Torso draws on top of limbs
Neck draws after torso
Head draws last
Drag points draw on top of everything

3. Neck Wiggle

New drawWiggleNeck() method with milder wiggle
Uses arc-like motion (sin(PI * pos)) instead of full wave
Slower animation (t * 0.5) for more natural movement
Fewer points (8 vs 20) for smoother curves

4. Head Rotation

New drawRotatedHead() method
Rotates head by dna.headRotation (±45 degrees)
Uses push()/pop() to isolate transformation

5. New DNA Properties

neckWiggle: 0-15 range (milder than limb wiggle)
headRotation: ±45 degrees
Both are included in mutations and UI updates

The ranges are now all data-driven, so you can easily adjust them in the DNA.RANGES object without hunting through the code. The draw order gives a much more natural layered appearance, and the neck wiggle and head rotation add nice character variation!
